Subject: [PATCH 18/28] arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix rk3588 USB power-domain
 clocks

The QoS blocks saved/restored when toggling the PD_USB power domain are
clocked by ACLK_USB. Attempting to access these memory regions without
that clock running will result in an indefinite CPU stall.

The PD_USB node wasn't specifying this clock dependency, resulting in
hangs when trying to toggle the power domain (either on or off), unless
we get "lucky" and have ACLK_USB running for another reason at the time.
This "luck" can result from the bootloader leaving USB powered/clocked,
and if no built-in driver wants USB, Linux will disable the unused
PD+CLK on boot when {pd,clk}_ignore_unused aren't given. This can also
be unlucky because the two cleanup tasks run in parallel and race: if
the CLK is disabled first, the PD deactivation stalls the boot. In any
case, the PD cannot then be reenabled (if e.g. the driver loads later)
once the clock has been stopped.

Fix this by specifying a dependency on ACLK_USB, instead of only
ACLK_USB_ROOT. The child-parent relationship means the former implies
the latter anyway.

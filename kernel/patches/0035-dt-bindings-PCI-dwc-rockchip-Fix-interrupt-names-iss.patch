Subject: [PATCH 35/83] dt-bindings: PCI: dwc: rockchip: Fix interrupt-names
 issue

The RK356x (and RK3588) have 5 ganged interrupts. For example the
"legacy" interrupt combines "inta/intb/intc/intd" with a register
providing the details, which specific interrupt triggered. The
interrupts from the second level are part of the Synopsys DW PCIe
System Information Interface (SII). Some of them are listed in the
Interrupt Signals section, the others are mostly common SII output
signals. The grouping and the ganged interrupt controllers are
specific to the Rockchip implementation.

Currently the binding is not specifying these interrupts resulting
in a bunch of errors for all rk356x/rk3588 boards using PCIe.

Fix this by specifying the interrupts and add them to the example
to prevent regressions.

This changes the reference from snps,dw-pcie.yaml to
snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml, since the interrupts are vendor
specific and should not be listed in the generic file. The
only other bit from the generic binding are the reg-names,
which are overwritten by this binding.

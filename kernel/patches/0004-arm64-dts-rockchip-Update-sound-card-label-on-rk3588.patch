Subject: [PATCH 04/81] arm64: dts: rockchip: Update sound card label on
 rk3588-rock-5b

The audio-graph-card driver uses the 'label' property to register the
sound card in the system, but the currently assigned string is too
generic and cannot be supported by alsa-project/alsa-ucm-conf:

  card 0: Analog [Analog]

Use the more specific naming "rk3588-es8316", which is still generic
enough to be shared with other compatible boards, e.g. Rock 5A. The
audio card will be listed as:

  card 0: rk3588es8316 [rk3588-es8316]

While at it, update also the DT node name, as there will be additional
sound related nodes available, i.e. for HDMI. Note that this involves
moving the node one position up, to preserve the alphabetical order.
